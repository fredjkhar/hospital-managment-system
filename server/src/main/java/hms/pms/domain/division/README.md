## Division/Ward

**Type**: Support

The Ward division is categorized as a support subdomain because it does not represent the main functionality of the PMS. However, this subdomain is critical for organizing patient hospitalization, ensuring proper bed management, and facilitating the work of medical staff in ensuring that each patient is placed correctly based on their medical needs. Several usage scenarios, such as Admit Patient, Discharge Patient, Visualize Division, and Admit Patient from the Request List, require direct interaction with this subdomain.
